## Why this tool

Quantum Circuit Studio is an original, independent research tool for sketching and reviewing **small superconducting quantum-circuit topologies** without requiring a cloud design service. It makes the local circuit graph explicit, then derives readable views, checks and exports from that one source model. The goal is not to imitate a full foundry workflow in a browser. The goal is to make early architectural decisions transparent, traceable and inexpensive to revisit.

> **The local JSON circuit document is the source of truth.** The Schematic, Topology Lens, Layer Stack, Frequency Map, Crosstalk Risk Map, optimizer and exports all derive from it.

## Quick start

Install dependencies, start the local workstation and open the Vite address printed in the terminal.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Validate the model contracts and produce a production build before sharing an implementation change.

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Load the included **transmon-microcell** demonstration, inspect a component, run local checks, then open the 3D and analytical views. The full step-by-step workflow is in [Getting started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Capabilities

| Capability | What it provides now | Deliberate boundary |
|---|---|---|
| **Editable schematic** | Local graph editing for transmons, couplers, resonators, feedlines and flux lines. | It is not a GDSII or mask editor. |
| **Topology Lens 3D** | A selectable WebGL graph of the same nodes and links. | It is a relationship view, not physical 3D geometry. |
| **Layer Stack** | Metal, Josephson, resonator and control proxies. | It is not a PDK or process stack. |
| **Frequency Map** | Nearest-neighbour spacing with `0.08 GHz` collision and `0.20 GHz` review states. | Values are local working assumptions, not calibration. |
| **Crosstalk Risk Map** | Explainable priority score from adjacency, schematic distance and detuning. | It is not EM extraction or a measured coupling prediction. |
| **Transparent optimizer** | Visible spacing and `0.25 GHz` frequency-target proposals. | It is not an EM, routing, yield or calibration solver. |
| **JSON export** | Portable complete local source model. | It does not add physical geometry or process data. |
| **OpenQASM 3 export** | Logical qubit, inferred `cz` and measurement scaffold. | It is not a calibrated pulse schedule or hardware result. |
| **STL / STEP export** | Conceptual Layer Stack proxies for discussion. | They are not fabrication or mechanical-release files. |

## Local validation ladder

![Local validation ladder and external engineering boundary](docs/images/validation-ladder.png)

The studio checks what its local model can actually know: IDs, graph links, readout-path intent, nominal frequencies, close-frequency warnings, topology projections and export contracts. When the question becomes physical — materials, device modes, coupling extraction, calibration, package effects or QPU execution — the model points to the proper next stage instead of inventing precision.

Read [Validation](docs/VALIDATION.md) for each local check, threshold and model boundary.

## Model boundary

Quantum Circuit Studio is intentionally useful **before** a full fabrication or execution workflow. It has no third-party design API calls and does not copy code, assets, schemas or compiler implementations from SilicoFeller or other design platforms. The public-reference review that led to this independent implementation is recorded in [`DISCOVERY_NOTES.md`](DISCOVERY_NOTES.md).

The project does not claim to perform electromagnetic extraction, full-wave analysis, material modelling, PDK validation, mask generation, packaging analysis, calibration, pulse compilation or QPU execution. Those steps require additional physical or backend-specific data. [Qiskit Metal](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-metal/) and the [OpenQASM specification](https://openqasm.com/intro.html) are examples of the separate design and execution layers that can become relevant after a local topology is mature.
